RAZA (Rapid 3D z-crossings algorithm) provides a robust, accurate, intuitive, fast, and generally applicable segmentation algorithm capable of detecting organelles, membranes, macromolecular as- semblies and extrinsic membrane protein domains. It defines each continuous contour within a tomogram as a discrete object and extracts a set of 3D structural fingerprints (major, middle and minor axes, surface area and volume), enabling selective, semi-automated segmentation and object extraction.
